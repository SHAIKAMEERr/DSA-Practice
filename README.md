# 🚀 DSA-Practice

Welcome to my **DSA-Practice** repository! 🌟

This repo is part of my daily commitment to enhance my problem-solving skills by practicing **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Java**. Every day, I will push new code covering different DSA topics as part of a self-driven challenge.

---

## 🌟 Challenge Objectives

* 📅 Practice **DSA daily** for consistent improvement.
* 🧠 Strengthen understanding of core topics:

  * Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists
  * Trees, Graphs, Recursion
  * Sorting, Searching, Hashing
  * Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, and more.
* 💻 Use **Java** for all implementations.
* 🔍 Practice on platforms like:

  * [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/SHAIK_AMEER_/)
  * [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
  * [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
