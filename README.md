# DSA-Practice 💻📘

Welcome to my **DSA-Practice** repository!

As part of my commitment to improve my problem-solving and programming skills, I have taken up a personal challenge to **practice Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) daily** using **Java**.

Every day, I’ll be pushing my code solutions here, with a log of the topic I’ve practiced. This will help me stay consistent, track progress, and improve over time.

## 🚀 Challenge Goal

* 📆 Practice **daily**.
* ✅ Focus on **core DSA concepts** like arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, recursion, sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.
* 🧠 Solve problems from platforms like LeetCode, GeeksForGeeks, Codeforces, etc.
* ☕ Use **Java** for implementation.
